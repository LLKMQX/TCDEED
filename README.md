EEG Emotion Dataset (Coming Soon)
This repository is for an upcoming EEG-based emotion recognition dataset.

This dataset was collected using a 60-channel ESI NeuroScan system and contains multi-channel EEG signals recorded from participants under audiovisual stimuli. It is intended to support research in affective computing and brain–computer interfaces. All experiments were approved by the ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. 

The dataset and related code will be released on a public platform after the official publication of the associated paper, accompanied by the necessary experimental description and user guidelines.

This dataset contains EEG data from 15 participants. Each participant’s data file is named numerically from 1 to 15 and saved in .mat format. Within each participant’s .mat file, there are 15 segments of EEG data, named data_1 to data_15. The corresponding emotion labels are [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], where 0, 1, and 2 represent different emotion categories. It should be noted that the presentation order of emotional stimuli during the experiment was not fixed as shown above; however, during data organization, samples belonging to the same emotion category were grouped together for subsequent processing. All data have undergone standardized preprocessing procedures.
