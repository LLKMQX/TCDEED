EEG Emotion Dataset (Coming Soon)
This repository is for an upcoming EEG-based emotion recognition dataset.

The dataset will be made publicly available after the official publication of our associated paper. It includes multi-channel EEG recordings collected under controlled emotional stimuli, aiming to support research in affective computing and brain-computer interface.

ðŸ“Œ Status:
Currently under embargo until paper publication. The data and full documentation will be released here soon.
